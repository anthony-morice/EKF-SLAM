# EFK-SLAM with known correspondences

This project was developed to fulfill the final requirements of the ***CSCI 5552 Sensing and Estimation in Robotics*** course offered at the University of Minnesota. The repository structure reflects the necessary file hierarchy of the ***Webots*** open source robot simulator that was used to run the extended kalman filter (EKF) based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm.

The EKF-SLAM implementation can be in [EKF-SLAM/controllers/diers040_project_controller/diers040_project_controller.py](controllers/diers040_project_controller/diers040_project_controller.py).

For specifics regarding control, localization, and path planning algorithms/strategies, please see [diers040_project-report.pdf](diers040_project-report.pdf).
